#What is the theme you'll be using for project 2?

Bubbles and chatting.

#How Did you incorporate your theme within your project?

I set a background image that had bubbles on it.

#What are known problems, if any, with your project?
At the moment it is missing offline persistence via database, third-party authentication,
chatbot, and general chatting functionality is not complete.

#How would you improve if if you had more time?
I would implement the features above.  I would also refactor the socket logic
in child components to a parent component for easier debugging.
